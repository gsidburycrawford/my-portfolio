      <h2>About Me:</h2>
      <p>I am certified by Cape Fear Community College as a Database Administrator and Programmer, 
        as well as an entry-level IT Technician.  I have also obtained a The National Career 
        Readiness Certificate from the ACT (with a platinum score) to receive these certifications. 
        My experience with technical documentation will allow me to speak with both coworkers, consumers, 
        and supervisors efficiently and effectively. I also have a proficiency in a variety of languages, 
        such as Java, C++, Python, SQL, JavaScript, and others documented on my resume. Using Microsoft 
        Visio, I can even create proper pseudo-code and flowcharts. This extended knowledge will have me
        performing above and beyond any expectations.</p>
